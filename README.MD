# Asthriona's Reaction time bot
hi, One morning I was bored and seen PewDiePie released a video on the well known website [Human Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/). I took the test after 7 month not login on my account and notice my reaction time was in the Averages.  i'm not average...   
I'm better than average! D: (jk i'm not.)  
So I decide to use my developement skills to make it better.   
There you go :p  
# Install
You need nodeJS on your computer. 
then clone this repo and move your console in the folder and type:
```
npm i
node app.js
```
then the program will analyze the color of the pixel at your mouse location and click id it's "4bdb6a" the hex color of the human benchmark green.  
also you have to click on the window the first time to start the test, this is not clicking the blue screen.
  
Please note that software cannot move your mouse and see your screen, only the color of the pixel wher your mouse is located, and will exit right after the click.  
I know I could make it even faster with a switch case probably or something like that but I'm too lazy :)  
Also please do not cheat on your account, we are humans, humans are shitty be proud of your non cheated result. this is mine:
